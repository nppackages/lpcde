# LPCDE

The `lpcde` package provides R implementation of bandwidth selection, point estimation and inference procedures for local polynomial conditional distribution and density methods.

This work was supported by the National Science Foundation through grant [SES-1947805](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1947805) and [SES-1947662](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1947662), and by the National Institutes of Health through grant [R01 GM072611-16](https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10093056).
